            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>
                This website is for the <a href='https://rustwasm.github.io'>
                Rust and WebAssembly Working Group</a> to help us track one of our
                most important metrics, file size, over time. There are a number of
                benchmarks that are rerun every night and we collect data for. The
                charts represent the size of these benchmarks and the various files
                they produce over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's important to keep in mind that file size is a coarse metric for
                measuring what really matters, time to user interaction. Small changes
                are expected over time, and this tracker is still and early project!
                If you want to get your own WebAssembly smaller be sure to stop by
                <a href='https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/code-size.html'>
                    our guide to shrinking compiled WebAssembly sizes</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Working Group hopes to use this tool to diagnose regressions to
                get fixed as well as hand out praise for improvements to file sizes.

                <li>At the top you can switch between absolute and relative data.
                    The absolute view will show you a graph of absolute file sizes over
                    time, whereas the relative view will show you all data relative to
                    the first data point, showing percentage change over time</li>

                <li>
                    Any graph line ending in (gz) represents measuring the corresponding
                    output after gzip default compression. This is hoped to get a
                    better idea of how file changes affect compressed (likely over the
                    wire) transfers.
